          <h2>THE BMW</h2>
          <h1>G 310 R</h1>
          <p>
            The strength of the G 310 R is in It's lightness and agility.The
            Bike not only delivers fun in the big-city tumult, also when you are
            redefining the city limits when charging corners quickly.
          </p>
          <h3 class="experience">Experience the agility</h3>
          <p>
            The unconventional single-cylinder engine has a special design:
            Compared to conventional designs, the cylinder head is rotated 180
            degrees, which pushes the vehicleâ€™s center of gravity towards the
            front wheel. This makes the G 310 R agile and easy to control. With
            the new Ride by Wire system, throttle response is stable and at the
            ready. And the self-reinforcing slipper clutch makes switching gears
            easy.
          </p>
